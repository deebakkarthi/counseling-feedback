I guess I just have to find another way to cope\nHelper: If you have financial issues and you need the help from a therapist you deserve the treatment. One thing you can do is apply for Medicaid and EBT. The state you live in will give you money to pay for groceries and to get help from a therapist for free if you don't have a high enough income.

Basically all started for jealousy and she saw a couple of text messages of my best friend and she misunderstood the conversation and since then its not the same.

Have you tried reassuring her that your intentions are pure and maybe gave her some words of affirmation that would let her know how you truly feel about her? Just because you guys are best friends all she sees in her head is that you're talking to another female.

So she decided to move away and gave us some spaces and think this out\nHelper: How long have you two been together? Sometimes moving on from a relationship and staying single from some time can give you time to reflect and work on yourself for yourself. You never know the two of you might come back together stronger than before cause space might be all that your relationship needs at this moment.

One of my classes is extremely difficult and the professor has not been responsive at all. The TA is kind enough to make time to help me with homework, but my grades are still not great. It makes me feel really dumb and undeserving to be in that class\nHelper: So you are feeling as though you are in the wrong place? Do you feel as though you might fail your class completely?\nSeeker: I want to be in the program, it's just that I feel like everyone is so much smarter than me and my performance in that class makes me question my admission into the programs sometimes. When I feel like this after submitting homework, I end up crying because I just want to do well. I enjoy this field, just not this class in particular. I'm afraid of failing, but I'm not sure if that should be a concern either. Over the past 3 years, no one has gotten a grade lower than a B.\nHelper: But do you really think that you would have been admitted to the class if you were not up to the standard? Do you think that maybe most of your classmates are secretly feeling the same?\nSeeker: Sometimes I think about that.

I think I need to break up with my girlfriend but she moved in last year and I don;' know how to approach it. I think I'm going to be in for a bad emotional time\nHelper: That seems like a tough situation! What feelings made you decide you need to breakup with her?\nSeeker: It's a bit of a mix. I don't find her attractive that much any more and I think that's important. Also since moving in she is difficult to live with. I can't see myself with her long term.\nHelper: I completely understand that. I recently broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year, because I didn't feel like I loved him as much as I used to. Things like that are important!. How long have you guys been together?\nSeeker: It's good that you have had a similar experience and understand what I'm going through. We dated for a while. The thing is she is Italian and has moved countries to live with me. I feel so bad that this has happened.\nHelper: Oh I see. That's a huge step to make in a relationship. So you are hesitant to break up with her because she moved just to be with you? Have you communicated with her about your concerns? Such as being difficult to live with?\nSeeker: Yes that's right, I helped her get a job and thought I'd just see how it goes. Her family loves me and thinks I'm great which makes this even more difficult. We have talked about things yes but she sees it as a bit of a joke I think.\nHelper: I think it's great that we got matched up, because I went through also the exact same situation. My boyfriend and I were long distance, and he moved across the country to be closer to me. So when I felt like we needed to break up, I was experiencing similar guilt that you are experiencing.\nSeeker: It's great that you understand this. I think being the man puts more pressure on me to look after her and make sure she. she's safe etc\nHelper: I want to reassure you, that doing what's best for you is what is most important! Your partner will understand this if they truly care for you. Things will be tough for a while, but you both will be able to grow from this experience. And just because you don't want to be in a relationship anymore, doesn't mean that you don't care about her!. Staying friends after the fact might take the pressure off of you a little bit. You can still help her out and be there for each other, but as friends instead of partner's.\nSeeker: To be honest, it's amazing that you have suggested this. It's really hard to balance my needs and feelings without breaking her heart. It's hard for the person that's dumped but actually I think it is equally hard for the dumper!\nHelper: Yes exactly! It's so difficult for the dumper as well, because of course you still have strong feelings for this person. They just aren't romantic anymore. And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love\nSeeker: That's exactly it. So do you think I should just talk to her and tell her how I feel? The thing is it's not like she can move out immediately. It's going to be a long drawn out experience.\nHelper: I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just \"kicking her to the curb.\" Things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard\nSeeker: Yes, I think I need to emphasize the friends element of it and potentially support her to move on. I suppose I'm fearful that it will never end but I'll need to face into that and stay strong, and obviously avoid being intimate as this would really hurt her if I continued to sleep with her. I need to be careful about that I think!\nHelper: Yes exactly. And from chatting with you, I can tell that you are a very caring person. You don't want to hurt her. I believe that you have the understanding of the situation, and you know what you should and shouldn't do in order to make it work. The hard part is simply getting the courage to finally discuss it. But I think you are going to be able to do that just fine!\nSeeker: I must say, you have been fantastic to talk to about this, we have had a similar experience so I think the advice is coming from experience. Thanks for that!\nHelper: What I've gathered about you as a person, makes me confident that you probably chose a partner that will be able to have this talk with you and you both will come to an understanding. Yes I think it's very great we were able to connect on our issues! It definitely helps.

How do you think I could do that?\nHelper: You can turn your anxiety into extra energy to plan and prepare. Having anxiety can give you a boost of energy, which gives you an advantage to achieve your goal.\nSeeker: I can probably do that, the anxiety can motivate me to create a studying plan\nHelper: Yes, indeed. Having anxiety will keep you anchored to your study plan which would increase your ability to perform well for the exam.\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [\"Validation\"], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to keep encouraging the seeker's exploration and provide emotional support.

I can't see myself with her long term.\nHelper: I completely understand that. I recently broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year, because I didn't feel like I loved him as much as I used to.

Her family loves me and thinks I'm great which makes this even more difficult.

My boyfriend and I were long distance, and he moved across the country to be closer to me.

But recently after I said I want to go on a trip with my boyfriend, my parents have all sorts of opinions about it. And all their traditional beliefs that I did not know existed are now on the surface and they are kinda forcing me to follow it. For say they think \"bad types of woman\" go on trips with their boyfriends and I need to save myself. They have been guilt tripping me and I feel very confused.\nHelper: Your feelings are valid and it is okay to feel confused in this situation considering you love your boyfriend and parents. Have you tried discussing with your boyfriend to talk to your parents as a means of reassuring them? Or getting someone neutral that your parents trust to talk to them?\nSeeker: I have. It's been a long stressful month of discussion. The problem is I don't share their beliefs, and I haven't been really \"saving myself\". I'm been living away from them for collage quite a while and I've been basically doing stuff that if they found out they would be very upset about. But I didn't think it bothers them because they never shared any of this. And they said if I go on this trip I'm disrespecting them and the entire family. But his parents are totally cool and don't seem to mind.\nHelper: I get how difficult and upsetting this situation is to you, i have been in a similar situation, however, in my case i took charge of my life, though they are my parents i did what i felt is good for me. Before i continue, do you mind me asking how old you are?\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [\"Empathy\"], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to empathize and reflect on the seeker's feelings.

Just want to feel as though I am still part of their lives.\nHelper: It's completely normal to feel like that. I have been in your exact shoes. I would suggest inviting one of them out for lunch or dinner and express face to face how you are feeling right now.\nSeeker: I was thinking the same thing, but I am unsure I feel awkward now, I feel like I do not them as I thought I did. I am unsure why I feel this way. one of them is my daughters god mother and the text are there but they are not like they use.. I am unsure if I should ask why she has time for others and not us... just saying it makes me feel weird. anyone there?\nHelper: She may be going through something at home or having family issues. We truly never know what the other person is going through unless we have that uncomfortable situation. My suggestion would be to rephrase that question slightly to her.\nSeeker: I agree with you, just seems really strange since we were inseparable before the pandemic.

I will, never did I think I would hesitate whats going on..\nHelper: It's completely natural. Instead of texting her, have you tried calling?\nSeeker: Yes, I have. The conversation have been superficial, like small talk. There is nothing to share, I am guessing. My daughter has had lots of dance functions despite the pandemic and yet I have not felt supported. Perhaps shes not okay with venturing out during the pandemic.. though I do see on social media shes meeting other friends in social settings. Perhaps I need to be more open and not be so distant? Maybe its me and I am not seeing it?\nHelper: How long have you been friends?\nSeeker: we are both 35 and we met in pre K. we are lifetime friends. shes a sister to me. At some point our parents use to live in the same apartment complex, our parents are great friends as well. I was there for her babies birth, when she found out what she was having. We have shared grand moments together.\nHelper: You both have been friends for such a long time. I'm so jealous of friendships like that. I would definitely ask her for lunch.

I guess I just have to find another way to cope\nHelper: If you have financial issues and you need the help from a therapist you deserve the treatment. One thing you can do is apply for Medicaid and EBT. The state you live in will give you money to pay for groceries and to get help from a therapist for free if you don't have a high enough income. It may be worth looking into because all you really need to do is fill out some forms and likely you will be approved.

You mean deep breaths do help? How often do i need the breaths?\nHelper: Of course, breathing is the body's most calming function, you dont need a set amount of breaths, but take the time to be aware of the action and the stillness around you. It would help more than you think it will. In this time that you have, I think it would be nice to take the time you have with your family and enjoy it\nSeeker: I actually feel the support from my wife for which i am grateful but then my children are young to understand it all. I used to do a lot for them and constantly tell me to do the same but am unable cause it needs money. It is quite unfortunate that in my family we are used to finding joy as a family outside the home setting which requires spending and this we are not able to meet it often times as we have had to reduce spending. Apart from deep breaths, what other ways can i use to manage my anxiety?\nHelper: Spending time actively playing with your kids would help, along with morning exercise (but nothing too strenuous) if you choose to do so. if you enjoy reading, I suggest taking the time to find a book that you used to enjoy and give it another read. it will remind you of a time when you were in a good place, and hopefully project that feeling back to you\nSeeker: Wow, am amazed! You mean anxiety can be managed so simply? Wanna give it a try\nHelper: I hope you do, positive attitude is the start to a healthy mind. This may not work for everything and the anxiety won't just disappear on day one or maybe ever, but these are steps you would want to start with :). Coping with anxiety is what you make of it, remember to not beat yourself up about things you ultimately cannot control.\nSeeker: sure. Let me adjust my attitude first and accept the situation.

Is there something specific going on or is it just life in general?\nSeeker: My daughter struggles with school work and memory. She learns differently and needs lots of support. I have contacted the school a number of times over the years but never really had any support or acknowledgement from them. I guess it's just an accumulation of things.\nHelper: You have tried hard to help her and that is admirable. Don't beat yourself up and be proud of the things you have done for her.\nSeeker: But what do I now. She's 17 and it's so difficult to give her the time and then encourage her to tell me when she needs help and for her to be willing to accept it.\nHelper: While I do not have kids, from what I have seen my friends and family do in this situation is try to find something that your daughter is interested in and attempt to build off of that. So instead of her learning to just learn, she is learning something that is relevant to her. Maybe that might spark something in her to come up with her way of learning since traditional methods aren't working.\nSeeker: That is great advice. She does climb and hasn't been able to climb or see her friends with everything closed. I think as she will be able to again soon may be that will help her to relax and get back into it. She does learn through repetition but has lacked enthusiasm especially in the last few months.\nHelper: Having her go climbing more sounds like a good plan. Hopefully things are opening up around you now that the vaccine is becoming more common. Repetition is tough. I know I used a lot of flash cards as a way of learning through high-school and college. It's an old method but it can work.\nSeeker: She had heart surgery as a baby so has actually had the vaccine herself as she's in the vulnerable category. I think she ends up spending so long making aide memoires that she then leaves herself so little time to actually study.\nHelper: I can imagine after having heart surgery as a baby she wants to live life to it's fullest extent and prioritizes making memories over school. Does she ever talk about what her plans are for after high-school? At some point she will have to connect the dots of having to get a job to be able to go out and have fun, and unfortunately doing OK in school comes with that. That or a vocational school to learn a trade (what I personally did).\nSeeker: What did you do? Her interests are music and photography. Recently she has started a gardening club with the horticulture department at school. She does enjoy her social life well when she has been able to have it. She has had social ups and downs but apart from the epidemic she has been happier than in her earlier years at school. You are right she is becoming an adult and will find her place. At 17 I guess she doesn't have to decide just yet. You have certainly made me feel a bit more positive.\nHelper: Sorry for the delay. I am glad you are feeling more positive. I was into cars so I went to vocational school to become an auto mechanic. After a couple years of that I realized I wasn't cut out for physical labor and went to college. But the knowledge from working on cars helped me understand things better at college since I had real world applications I could use it on. Gardening and Horticulture is a great hobby!

So instead of her learning to just learn, she is learning something that is relevant to her. Maybe that might spark something in her to come up with her way of learning since traditional methods aren't working.\nSeeker: That is great advice. She does climb and hasn't been able to climb or see her friends with everything closed. I think as she will be able to again soon may be that will help her to relax and get back into it. She does learn through repetition but has lacked enthusiasm especially in the last few months.\nHelper: Having her go climbing more sounds like a good plan. Hopefully things are opening up around you now that the vaccine is becoming more common. Repetition is tough. I know I used a lot of flash cards as a way of learning through high-school and college. It's an old method but it can work.\nSeeker: She had heart surgery as a baby so has actually had the vaccine herself as she's in the vulnerable category. I think she ends up spending so long making aide memoires that she then leaves herself so little time to actually study.\nHelper: I can imagine after having heart surgery as a baby she wants to live life to it's fullest extent and prioritizes making memories over school. Does she ever talk about what her plans are for after high-school? At some point she will have to connect the dots of having to get a job to be able to go out and have fun, and unfortunately doing OK in school comes with that. That or a vocational school to learn a trade (what I personally did).\nSeeker: What did you do? Her interests are music and photography. Recently she has started a gardening club with the horticulture department at school. She does enjoy her social life well when she has been able to have it. She has had social ups and downs but apart from the epidemic she has been happier than in her earlier years at school. You are right she is becoming an adult and will find her place. At 17 I guess she doesn't have to decide just yet. You have certainly made me feel a bit more positive.\nHelper: Sorry for the delay. I am glad you are feeling more positive. I was into cars so I went to vocational school to become an auto mechanic. After a couple years of that I realized I wasn't cut out for physical labor and went to college. But the knowledge from working on cars helped me understand things better at college since I had real world applications I could use it on. Gardening and Horticulture is a great hobby! That definitely could cross over into some of her science classes to make things more interesting and relevant to her.\nSeeker: Thank you so much for your time and kindness today. You helped me refocus and some of the things you said were just what I needed to hear.\nHelper: Glad I was able to help. Sometimes just having someone to bounce things off of makes a big difference.

Lately i've been holding it in and just barely responding if at all. I've told one of them that i have no money and she hasn't contacted me since. But if she tries again i'll say something about the issue. I don't like feeling used. Who even has the nerve to blatantly use somebody like that? It's irritating\nHelper: It's good that you let them know how you feel. By doing that, you are taking the first step in now allowing them to take advantage of you\nSeeker: Agreed. I just hope that one day I can meet people and form actual friendships with them\nHelper: It's really hard to stand up for yourself but it sounds like you are off to a good start. Have you taken any steps in trying to form new more meaningful relationships\nSeeker: I thought I did. My husband and I made a couple friends. Theyre a couple and so are we so we go on double dates but they seem more drawn to him. Me and the other girl got very close and then boom she randomly decided she only wants to talk to me when shes mad or bored\nHelper: So feel that this new couple might value the friendship with your husband more then you\nSeeker: yeah it seems that way. Most people like him more than me and it's weird because he sucks at socializing and doesn't even like them that much. It just doens't make sense but that's just the way the ca rds were dealt\nHelper: I used to have a hard time forming a meaningful relationship but then I realized it's because I had nothing in common with the people I was trying to form them with. Once I discovered something I was really drawn to I met people that way like volunteering in my community. Have you tried finding people you have more in common with.\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to help the seeker explore potential solutions to their problem.

I'm wanting to maybe move into freelance work but the market is flooded because of covid. So many working from home and freelancing these days.\nHelper: You are right. I feel your anxiety in this. Competition is high in all industries right now it seems. Maybe sign up with those employment sites online. Indeed, ZipRecuiter, etc...it can't hurt to see what other options are out there.\nSeeker: Not sure what is going to happen to my industry. The demand for new products is astounding.

This is a really hard time of year for me. I lost my cousin in a car accident at the age of 14 in a car accident coming up on 20 years this year. We were very close. I was 17 at the time. Her was an alcoholic and my parents raised her a majority of her life. Then 3 years ago 5 days after her death anniversary I lost my boyfriend at the age of 32 in a car accident. I dread the holidays.\nHelper: Thank you for sharing that. It sounds like you are describing a strong association between the holiday season and loss of loved ones. This leads to less of a desire to engage in typical holiday events. Does that sound right?\nSeeker: You are exactly right. The year my cousin got killed her mom was hungover so I went and picked up my cousin and her little brother to take them to our grandparents house for Christmas dinner. She died 4 days later on Dec 29th. And my boyfriend it was his first day back to work after the New Year. He died on Jan 3rd. I usually go all out for the holidays to try to hide my depression every year. This year I just can't bring myself to enjoy them. I have even bought one christmas present.\nHelper: I can see why this time of year is difficult for you. Trying to hide depression can be a challenge. Rather than hiding the sadness or grieving feelings, some people find relief in acknowledging and sharing these feelings with family members who may relate. Do you ever share these feelings with your cousin or grandparents that you mentioned?\nSeeker: My cousin doesn't live around here and we have never been real close. He is alot younger than me. We just never had the connection like his sister and I did. And both my grandparents have passed away. Grandpa has been gone for 12 years and Grandma has been gone for 4 now. My family has always been really good about talking about our loses. Things just will never be the same.\nHelper: I understand. When losses are experienced it is a great change in many aspects of our lives. Are there any aspects of the holidays that bring you joy? Maybe holiday music, movies, bright snow (if there is snow where you live), or seeing joy on someone's face when you give them a great gift?\nSeeker: They say it gets easier. And I agree it does. Things just have changed so much. I miss how life was before I lost them.\nHelper: I understand - and it is normal to feel that way. When we lose someone who brought us happiness, it is only natural to miss them and their company.\nSeeker: I love giving gifts. And I always put lots of thought into the gifts I give. My nieces and nephews can't wait every year to see what I got them.\nHelper: That's great! You must have a special talent for personalizing your gift selections. Perhaps focus on that reaction from you nieces and nephews to support your motivation for giving gifts this year.\nSeeker: This year I am tie dying hooded sweatshirts. I make tshirts for a hobby. And to tell you the truth thats the only gifts I have gotten so far. My oldest daughter turned 18 this year and lives with her boyfriend so its just me and my 15 year old daughter. She struggles with depression\/anxiety as well. Her dad has been in jail for some stupid actions since August. She has had to deal with him being an addict pretty much her whole life. I think we are both missing how the holidays were with her sister still living at home. Too much change in our lives in such a little time frame.\nHelper: It sounds like you and your daughter are experiencing a lot of difficult changes. What are some things that bring you joy during these challenging times?\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Empathy\", \"Validation\"]}<\/s>"}

Do you have anyone in your life, a friend or family member who you can lean on when you're feeling so sad?\nSeeker: I have a best friend but she told me that she didn't like my boyfriend from the beginning so she is glad that we broke up. Well, that I got dumped.\nHelper: It sounds like it's hard to have your best friend not be as supportive as you want during this hard time. What has been helping you to pass the time these days- do you have any activities or hobbies that you like to do to relax, have fun, or take your mind of things?\nSeeker: I have been wanting to buy a bike and start taking my dog out for little bike rides. I want to get one with a basket and have her sit in the front. I just hate being alone and I feel so sad about doing everything alone now.\nHelper: That sounds like a great idea! Doing something you enjoy, like biking with your dog, can be a really good way to manage feelings of sadness. It sounds like your dog is a big comfort to you.\n\n### Response:{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Self-disclosure\", \"Empathy\", \"Validation\"]}<\/s>"}
