Finding work in this environment can be stressful as well. In any case, I can say that a good way to start is to account for all transactions you make.\nSeeker: I have already been budgeting extensively, the issue is I can't make enough to cover my basic expenses, no matter how much I cut them\nHelper: Are you also pressed for time? Time management can be a predicament as well.\nSeeker: I have lots of free time, just waiting for unemployment to respond to my claims, applying for jobs online, and trying services like mturk to earn what I can from home in the meantime. I spend a good portion of my day trying to apply for everything I can and fixating on mturk tasks to make me feel like I'm accomplishing something\nHelper: Wow, it's slightly uncanny the way our situations are similar.

It's not fun at all to have neighbors who make you feel as though you're somehow less than them. I know exactly what that feels like.\nSeeker: Yep! That's how I feel. What should I do to get back in good graces with them?\nHelper: I do know people who have gone through the exact same thing in the past. When another animal attacks one of your fur-babies, it's absolutely terrible. However, the fact that this woman was given the option to either get rid of her dog or move tells me that you are 100% correct in the way that you handled this situation. It's unfortunate for the woman, yes, but she should have had more control over her dog. It's bad enough when one animal is attacked, but when it's more than one, that's when you really know that it's a problem. Again, legally, she had to make a choice, and that's because she failed to properly secure her dog. I really don't feel as though you did anything wrong. If I were you, I would ask to speak with the neighbors who have an issue with you face-to-face. I know it may be difficult, but I think that would be the best way to go about it. Are you on good terms with the other person whose dog was attacked?\nSeeker: I totally agree with you! The woman is disabled and I think most of the neighbors feel sorry for her. I've seen her loose control of the dog before, but she never attacked another dog(s). I've even seem the dog pull her scooter over and the woman needed lots of help to get back into it. I think everyone feels sorry for her.\nHelper: That probably has a lot to do with it. I would feel sorry for her too, as it is very sad in general. However, it doesn't excuse the fact that her animal attacked two other dogs.\nSeeker: I've talked to the neighbors face-to-face and they just think that I overreacted. The woman started getting her dog and private training and so they feel that she was trying. My point was that my dog weighs 15 pounds and her dog weighs 45 pounds and, if it happens again, I may not have a dog anymore. I don't want to wait until a dog is killed or badly injured. I told them exactly what you just said, but they are being mean!. I guess I could try talking to them again.

There is a concept called Maslow's hierarchy of needs, and sometimes I find it useful to think about if my needs are being met, and which is lacking. Which is to say, obviously financial security is your primary need at the moment, but there are other needs you must attend to as well, including your physical comforts. In times of great stress and upheaval, there is only so much you can do. The rest is worry, a hamster running in a wheel, a huge output of energy that does nothing at all.\nSeeker: Yeah that makes sense but I've spent so much time thinking about my finances that I've sort of burned myself out. Like I have no energy even to be thankful for the other little stuff\nHelper: That makes sense.

I feel like crying all the time and I feel like the sadness will never end. I have sense of overwhelming sadness as if my heart is sinking or like I am on a sinking ship. I wake up in the middle of the night and I am gasping for air, too.\nHelper: Thanks for sharing that with me. I'm so sorry you've been feeling like that. Breakups are so hard and can cause so much grief.\nSeeker: Yes, I feel like I will never meet anyone else and that I wasted so much time.\nHelper: I know those feelings of sadness can feel like they will never end- I have felt that way too before.\nSeeker: Do you feel like the best part of your life was over? That is how I feel now. Its seem like all of my plans for the future are over and ruined.\nHelper: But they do pass eventually and become easier to manage- with time and care. Do you have anyone in your life, a friend or family member who you can lean on when you're feeling so sad?\nSeeker: I have a best friend but she told me that she didn't like my boyfriend from the beginning so she is glad that we broke up. Well, that I got dumped.\nHelper: It sounds like it's hard to have your best friend not be as supportive as you want during this hard time. What has been helping you to pass the time these days- do you have any activities or hobbies that you like to do to relax, have fun, or take your mind of things?\nSeeker: I have been wanting to buy a bike and start taking my dog out for little bike rides. I want to get one with a basket and have her sit in the front. I just hate being alone and I feel so sad about doing everything alone now.\nHelper: That's a great idea. I love taking walks and bike rides outside when I feel down. I also have a little dog and she helps me whenever I'm feeling lonely- dogs are great at providing comfort and unconditional love.\nSeeker: I just bought my puppy and she is super comforting. I think that because she was a recuse dog I feel a greater attachment. It is kind of nice having her.\nHelper: Since you mentioned you enjoy spending time with your dog, maybe you could try going to a local park or a dog park. It might be a good way to meet new people and who knows, your dog could even be a great icebreaker!\n\n","completion":"{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Self-disclosure\", \"Suggestions\"]}"}

Did I shut her out? Was she needing more from me? Maybe I could be more open? I'm not sure.

I guess I can look into that. I am from Ohio. That's not bad advice. I am somewhat kicking myself for paying so much money on education that wasn't really worth that much. I guess there isn't much I can do about that, though\nHelper: Im sorry you feel that way but education is never a wasted effort it can only make you level up even if you choose not to actively use what you acquire. Its always nice to have a big back up arsenal so you have options when something you want does turn up. Im really glad that suggestion might be helpful for you. Have you checked to see if any of the credits you have earned already are transferable to another degree you may find of interest?\nSeeker: I suppose there can be truth in that. I had a friend say that as well, that education is never a wasted effort. I agree sometimes. I should have thought about the program more before I went into it, but ah, oh well.

I was pulled off of an important project last week and I'm a bit mad about it. I spent 6 months on something that now I have to let go and start helping another engineering team at work.\nHelper: You seem very concerned about this. It seems quite unfair! How do you feel about helping the other engineer?\nSeeker: I don't mind the work. The manager we have is very biased against us older engineers. He thinks we want to constantly help out the younger guys he hired. THey are mostly unqualified and their work is sub par. I'm 41 and the new guys are all about 24.\nHelper: I understand how stressful this must feel to you. Sounds like you are a great experienced worker, but they want to use your expertise instead to train the inexperienced worker.\nSeeker: yes. I have been reluctant to complain to upper management. I have a couple of co-workers who have my level of experience. They have complained and supposedly one of them will be our manager soon. I have thought about looking for a new job. Covid protocol has kept me from making a move though.\nHelper: I understand that. I think you have a legitimate complaint. Maybe go to upper management and make it more like a concern than a complaint? If you word it right, they will believe that you really care about your job (I can tell that you really do). I am sure they don't want to lose you.\nSeeker: Thing is in my industry, aerospace interiors, the competition is cut throat in engineering. I already have to work about 55 hours\/week. I do mturk to pay my phone bill (sort of a bet with my wife lol). I'm wanting to maybe move into freelance work but the market is flooded because of covid. So many working from home and freelancing these days.\nHelper: You are right. I feel your anxiety in this. Competition is high in all industries right now it seems. Maybe sign up with those employment sites online. Indeed, ZipRecuiter, etc...it can't hurt to see what other options are out there.\nSeeker: Not sure what is going to happen to my industry. The demand for new products is astounding. For example we have been working on cargo holds for aircraft that replaces seats and maintains social distancing protocols. I actually got this job through zip recruiter. Well I was put in contact with a recruiter who listed the job. Started as a contract and went direct after a year.\nHelper: Wow that sounds super interesting. You have nothing to lose going to upper management though with your concern.

Yes, then they definitely are taking advantage. Have you read anything on setting boundaries and learning how to say no?\nSeeker: Yeah, I\u2019m working on taking care of myself more than worrying about everyone else. I think the holidays make it even harder to set the boundaries\nHelper: I had learned once that it is so important to be able to easily say no because then we are free to say yes. Because if we say yes because we CAN'T say no, then we feel resentful. So If I can freely say no to you, then i am free to say yes, if that makes sense. Although for me, it was hard to say no, but it gets easier, now it is easy. It wasn't at first.\nSeeker: Thank you! You have been very helpful. I think that will be my goal! Start learning to say no and don\u2019t feel guilty about it. I think I am going to lower my expectations from other people and just start treating people as they treat me!\nHelper: If I always say yes, because I can't say no, I feel obligated and resentful, when really, it's me with the problem, I had a hard time saying no because I didn't want to hurt people. Now, I do the right thing in my heart, if I want to help, I help, if I want to say no, I say no even if it is hard, I don't care if they get upset. I can say no, that's true freedom. I don't advise treating people the way they treat you though. I would remain a kind person. Be the person you are no matter what type of person they are. You have to stand before God one day. If they are ugly, that's on them. But you want to be a kind person. That's the right thing, and you CAN be kind and say no. Those two are fine together! :D.

If you don't get close to anyone and wear a mask, you should be fine\nSeeker: Yeah, that is what they are saying in the news.

There is a study group of people in my class. I am preparing really well but I've struggled with this class so much that I still get really worried.\nHelper: It sounds like you are preparing well but are still worried that it won't be enough.

It's hard to know if the information is really getting into my head, and if I'm actually understanding it all.\nHelper: Sometimes taking a break and clearing your mind, taking a few deep breaths, can help people calm down. Is that something you can do?\nSeeker: I have tried that. And it does kind of help in the moment. It's when I get back to studying that all of the anxiety sets in. And it gets worse as it gets closer to the test. If I'm not studying, I feel guilty that I'm taking a break.\nHelper: I understand that. I have felt the same way before. But I realized I don't have to feel guilty for taking a break. It's important for my mental health.\nSeeker: And I try to remember that, too. And I know that's right. But in the moment I feel guilty, so it's so hard for me to relax taking a break.\nHelper: Just in the conversation I can see how stressed out you are and struggling with how to handle that.\nSeeker: Yes. Once my head is in this stressful mode, it's hard to break free.\nHelper: Sometimes talking with a close friend can help. Have you tried that?\nSeeker: I have. And that does help in the moment.

Basically all started for jealousy and she saw a couple of text messages of my best friend and she misunderstood the conversation and since then its not the same. She doesnt trust me\nHelper: I see trust is a very important key factor in relationships and without it the relationship stays stagnant. Have you tried reassuring her that your intentions are pure and maybe gave her some words of affirmation that would let her know how you truly feel about her? Just because you guys are best friends all she sees in her head is that you're talking to another female. Maybe she also has her wall up and some insecurities that you can help her with.\nSeeker: I tried in many way to help her with that and proving her that my feelings toward her was pure. I basically stop talking to my best friend to gain her confidence. But it did not work. So it got to the point that nothing was the same. So she decided to move away and gave us some spaces and think this out\nHelper: How long have you two been together? Sometimes moving on from a relationship and staying single from some time can give you time to reflect and work on yourself for yourself. You never know the two of you might come back together stronger than before cause space might be all that your relationship needs at this moment. I know this might be so tough for you but l want you to know that you are never alone and you can do this. Maybe read a new book or pick up a new hobby for the time being.\nSeeker: We were together for two years. Im trying my best to go through this. I hope so. Thanks for all those words. It really helps\nHelper: You're doing the right thing by talking to someone about it. We are not meant to be alone in our thoughts because it can be a scary thing. Bottling up emotions is also never good so for you to reach out is very good and the first step to maybe feeling a little better. I've been in your same shoes and trust me it doesn't feel good so just know I am here for you and you can talk to me in confidence.\nSeeker: Well thank so much. You really help me a lot with every single word. Well i have to go. Ill talk to you later\nHelper: Thank you for sharing your feelings with me.

I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant. I know this seems hard, but I believe that you can do it!\nSeeker: I will give it a try, but it's very hard for me to swallow the way she has treated me.\nHelper: People change sometimes and it is hard to understand. I want you to know that you are ENOUGH! You are smart and beautiful. Maybe it's time for this relationship to come to a close, but other people will come your way that will treat you like you deserve. I know it's painful now, but you will be stronger and better for going through this.\nSeeker: Thanks for understanding, I feel better now. I will give it sometime and if I don't feel like it or don't hear from her any more, I will take it that it's time to move on.\nHelper: I think that is a good approach. You will get through this!\nSeeker: You have been a big help and I can't thank you enough\nHelper: Anytime. I hope your feeling even a little better.

I'd love to talk about my current dilemma in my friend circle.\nHelper: Can you share the dilemma you are having?\nSeeker: Basically. This has happened for as long as I can remember, even back when I was a little kid. Any friend i've ever had has just used me for SOME gain. Whether that be boredom, money, or an emotional support pillow. I'm so sick of it. They'll literally ignore me for months and randomly text me for money. If i respond theyll read my messages then ignore me until they need money again. Or, they'll use me to throw alllll their problems onto me and never do the same for me. In some way shape or form- every person I become friends with uses me and throws me away when theyre done. Sometimes I feel like it must be me. Maybe i',m annoying?

I don't LET people walk all over me but it seems like that;s all I attract.\nHelper: So you feel under valued in your relationships because people tend to take advantage of you.\nSeeker: Pretty much. it just happens every single time.

I already know they won't respond but atleast ill say my peace\nHelper: After you tell them how you feel do you still give them money or listen to what's going on and try to help them.\nSeeker: No. Whenever I do get to say my peace, i'll just cut contact completely. Lately i've been holding it in and just barely responding if at all. I've told one of them that i have no money and she hasn't contacted me since.

It seems as if you are being treated badly for no genuine reason. Is this correct?\nSeeker: That is correct.\nHelper: Who is treating you badly?

I am sorry that is occurring, but applaud you for your efforts in trying to express your frustration.\nSeeker: Thank you. It gets trying at times. Tonight, I just sit in the dark alone because it isn't worth the hassle.\nHelper: I can tell from chatting with you that you are struggling and fed up with this situation because you are trying very hard in your marriage but get nothing but disrespect in return.\nSeeker: That is for sure. Most of the time it is just the way life is but there are days I get fed up and it irritates me. It has been this way for a while.\nHelper: From what I have seen, if a situation like this continues, not only will you be consumed with anger towards your husband which will all come out at once, but it may also lead to divorce based on research I have read about.\nSeeker: I won't divorce...even if I am miserable, that isn't an option.\nHelper: I understand. I would prefer to work out a situation rather than use divorce as an option as well, but I am concerned with how miserable you have become.\nSeeker: I have gotten used to it. It is the way I am supposed to live my life I guess.\nHelper: Some people respond to different strategies. You have tried communication through words to tell your husband your feelings, but have you shown him the consequences of his actions? Does he see how miserable you are? I suppose I wonder if you are interested in utilizing different strategies to find a solution to your issues with your husband and any others who may treat you badly.\nSeeker: He knows I am miserable. He knows I am upset. He is the living room watching tv and I am in the bedroom. It doesn't bother him that I am upset. It is getting late where I am and I should probably go to bed soon.\nHelper: Alright. I have enjoyed talking to you, and hope that things will work out for you. My last suggestion is possibly to try to talk your husband into couple's therapy and see how he responds. Even if he responds negatively, at least you have tried to dissolve the issue once again.

I think I need to break up with my girlfriend but she moved in last year and I don;' know how to approach it. I think I'm going to be in for a bad emotional time\nHelper: That seems like a tough situation! What feelings made you decide you need to breakup with her?\nSeeker: It's a bit of a mix. I don't find her attractive that much any more and I think that's important. Also since moving in she is difficult to live with. I can't see myself with her long term.\nHelper: I completely understand that. I recently broke up with my boyfriend earlier this year, because I didn't feel like I loved him as much as I used to. Things like that are important!. How long have you guys been together?\nSeeker: It's good that you have had a similar experience and understand what I'm going through. We dated for a while. The thing is she is Italian and has moved countries to live with me. I feel so bad that this has happened.\nHelper: Oh I see. That's a huge step to make in a relationship. So you are hesitant to break up with her because she moved just to be with you? Have you communicated with her about your concerns? Such as being difficult to live with?\nSeeker: Yes that's right, I helped her get a job and thought I'd just see how it goes. Her family loves me and thinks I'm great which makes this even more difficult. We have talked about things yes but she sees it as a bit of a joke I think.\nHelper: I think it's great that we got matched up, because I went through also the exact same situation. My boyfriend and I were long distance, and he moved across the country to be closer to me. So when I felt like we needed to break up, I was experiencing similar guilt that you are experiencing.\nSeeker: It's great that you understand this. I think being the man puts more pressure on me to look after her and make sure she. she's safe etc\nHelper: I want to reassure you, that doing what's best for you is what is most important! Your partner will understand this if they truly care for you. Things will be tough for a while, but you both will be able to grow from this experience. And just because you don't want to be in a relationship anymore, doesn't mean that you don't care about her!. Staying friends after the fact might take the pressure off of you a little bit. You can still help her out and be there for each other, but as friends instead of partner's.\nSeeker: To be honest, it's amazing that you have suggested this. It's really hard to balance my needs and feelings without breaking her heart. It's hard for the person that's dumped but actually I think it is equally hard for the dumper!\nHelper: Yes exactly! It's so difficult for the dumper as well, because of course you still have strong feelings for this person. They just aren't romantic anymore. And that is okay. You don't need to feel guilty for things that you can't control. You can still be there for her without pretending to be in love\nSeeker: That's exactly it. So do you think I should just talk to her and tell her how I feel? The thing is it's not like she can move out immediately. It's going to be a long drawn out experience.\nHelper: I think talking to her and being transparent about your feelings is definitely the right move. In doing this, reassure her you still want to be friends and you aren't just \"kicking her to the curb.\" Things will obviously be awkward for the first little bit, because continuing to live together will bring it's own difficulties. But the beautiful thing about that is, you guys are already used to it. :) So it's only hard if you make it hard\nSeeker: Yes, I think I need to emphasize the friends element of it and potentially support her to move on. I suppose I'm fearful that it will never end but I'll need to face into that and stay strong, and obviously avoid being intimate as this would really hurt her if I continued to sleep with her. I need to be careful about that I think!\nHelper: Yes exactly. And from chatting with you, I can tell that you are a very caring person. You don't want to hurt her. I believe that you have the understanding of the situation, and you know what you should and shouldn't do in order to make it work. The hard part is simply getting the courage to finally discuss it. But I think you are going to be able to do that just fine!\nSeeker: I must say, you have been fantastic to talk to about this, we have had a similar experience so I think the advice is coming from experience.

It's bad enough when one animal is attacked, but when it's more than one, that's when you really know that it's a problem.

If I were you, I would ask to speak with the neighbors who have an issue with you face-to-face. I know it may be difficult, but I think that would be the best way to go about it. Are you on good terms with the other person whose dog was attacked?\nSeeker: I totally agree with you! The woman is disabled and I think most of the neighbors feel sorry for her.

Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGive feedback to the Helper's last response.\n\n### Input:\nSeeker: I wrote about it. I was pulled off of an important project last week and I'm a bit mad about it. I spent 6 months on something that now I have to let go and start helping another engineering team at work.\nHelper: You seem very concerned about this. It seems quite unfair! How do you feel about helping the other engineer?\nSeeker: I don't mind the work. The manager we have is very biased against us older engineers. He thinks we want to constantly help out the younger guys he hired. THey are mostly unqualified and their work is sub par. I'm 41 and the new guys are all about 24.\nHelper: I understand how stressful this must feel to you. Sounds like you are a great experienced worker, but they want to use your expertise instead to train the inexperienced worker.\nSeeker: yes. I have been reluctant to complain to upper management. I have a couple of co-workers who have my level of experience. They have complained and supposedly one of them will be our manager soon. I have thought about looking for a new job. Covid protocol has kept me from making a move though.\nHelper: I understand that. I think you have a legitimate complaint. Maybe go to upper management and make it more like a concern than a complaint? If you word it right, they will believe that you really care about your job (I can tell that you really do). I am sure they don't want to lose you.\nSeeker: Thing is in my industry, aerospace interiors, the competition is cut throat in engineering. I already have to work about 55 hours\/week. I do mturk to pay my phone bill (sort of a bet with my wife lol). I'm wanting to maybe move into freelance work but the market is flooded because of covid. So many working from home and freelancing these days.\nHelper: You are right. I feel your anxiety in this. Competition is high in all industries right now it seems. Maybe sign up with those employment sites online. Indeed, ZipRecuiter, etc...it can't hurt to see what other options are out there.\nSeeker: Not sure what is going to happen to my industry. The demand for new products is astounding. For example we have been working on cargo holds for aircraft that replaces seats and maintains social distancing protocols. I actually got this job through zip recruiter. Well I was put in contact with a recruiter who listed the job. Started as a contract and went direct after a year.\nHelper: Wow that sounds super interesting. You have nothing to lose going to upper management though with your concern. I have been in management and when employees came to me with concerns and showed me how much they cared about their job to take the time to bring me their input.\nSeeker: I've been looking but the market is flooded. I might just retire earlier than anticipated. take on some freelance to supplement my income. Upper management at my company is a bit...shall we say...uninterested in boat rockers.\nHelper: I understand that. Freelance does equal freedom. Research opportunities. You sound like a smart man.\nSeeker: Boeing is a place I'd love to finish our my career with but I went through a 2 year hiring process with them a few years ago. Once I was offered the position I had to decline because the move to Washington was not feasible at the time because of family issues. oh well.\nHelper: How does moving to WA. seem at this time? Boeing is an amazing company.\nSeeker: I'd do it. I think they have a hiring freeze on at the moment. Gulfstram in Georgia is close to me. They have been hiring contractors like gang busters. Problem is that is a terrible company. chew you up and spit you out. What industry were you a manger in?\nHelper: Advertising. Sounds like you have options. Hang tight for the next few months and see where the world is headed. Time are so uncertain right now, but hey, it can only get better from here.\n\n","completion":"{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [\"Empathy\"], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to provide support and understanding during the seeker's career uncertainty.

I wake up in the middle of the night and I am gasping for air, too.\nHelper: Thanks for sharing that with me. I'm so sorry you've been feeling like that. Breakups are so hard and can cause so much grief.\nSeeker: Yes, I feel like I will never meet anyone else and that I wasted so much time.\nHelper: I know those feelings of sadness can feel like they will never end- I have felt that way too before.\nSeeker: Do you feel like the best part of your life was over? That is how I feel now. Its seem like all of my plans for the future are over and ruined.\nHelper: But they do pass eventually and become easier to manage- with time and care. Do you have anyone in your life, a friend or family member who you can lean on when you're feeling so sad?\nSeeker: I have a best friend but she told me that she didn't like my boyfriend from the beginning so she is glad that we broke up. Well, that I got dumped.\nHelper: It sounds like it's hard to have your best friend not be as supportive as you want during this hard time. What has been helping you to pass the time these days- do you have any activities or hobbies that you like to do to relax, have fun, or take your mind of things?\nSeeker: I have been wanting to buy a bike and start taking my dog out for little bike rides. I want to get one with a basket and have her sit in the front. I just hate being alone and I feel so sad about doing everything alone now.\nHelper: That's a great idea. I love taking walks and bike rides outside when I feel down. I also have a little dog and she helps me whenever I'm feeling lonely- dogs are great at providing comfort and unconditional love.\nSeeker: I just bought my puppy and she is super comforting. I think that because she was a recuse dog I feel a greater attachment. It is kind of nice having her.\nHelper: My dog has also helped me meet other people and make friends- sometimes I'll walk my dog with others or go on bike rides with friends. If there is a dog park or local park nearby, maybe you can go and talk to other people there- talking about your dogs is a great icebreaker!\nSeeker: I know about a local dog park and think I will visit it today.

Is there something specific you're struggling with?\nSeeker: It is, thank you. I think I need to cope with self isolation better.

You're right I am losing my sense of self, that is a very good way to put it.\nHelper: It's completely normal to have that sense of guilt for feeling that way as well. This whole situation is not ideal for anyone, which somehow makes it worse. It's hard to talk to someone about these feelings when you know everyone else is in the same or worse situation.\nSeeker: It is very hard to talk to someone about these feelings, when we are all going through it. How have you been able to maintain your sense of self? Any tips?\nHelper: It's taken a while to figure it out and get on the same page with my husband, but I try and practice self-care when possible. It can be something as simple as going for a walk alone or sitting and reading alone. There's no shame in needing some time alone to reset.\nSeeker: Thank you for your empathy and understanding. You are so right, self care is so important as a mom, especially right now. My husband doesn't understand that just by going to work he is able to escape for a little while. I will definitely try to practice more self care. Good luck to you and thank you for your advise! You have been very helpful.\nHelper: I'm glad to hear it, good luck to you as well.

The company I work for has had layoffs and is talking about it again in a few months. This makes me really nervous\nHelper: It seems like that fear of losing your job has been taking a toll on you.\nSeeker: It has indeed. I chose an industry that was fairly stable and a company that hadn't done layoffs in a long time but COVID changed all of that.\nHelper: Yeah, COVID is an unprecedented time where anything can happen. It must be frustrating knowing the safe path was taken but even then jobs might be taken away for something out of your control.\nSeeker: Yes! Exactly and I cannot stand that. I love my routine and predicability.\nHelper: I can relate to that. It's always nice when everything falls into place. The prospect of a sudden change stresses me out and I imagine you've been feeling the same way as well. What's your fear if you lose your job?\nSeeker: Very much so. If I lose my job I can't pay my bills and keep a roof over my head. In a good economy it took me over 300 applications, 50 interviews, and over 6 months to find a job.\nHelper: I think even if you lose your job, you would still be able to obtain resources through unemployment or even a stay at home temporary job from an employment agency while you look for another one or for your company to return to normal.\nSeeker: I would hope so\nHelper: I can definitely relate. I've submitted around that many applications if not more before I found my current job. But working as a temp at other companies has helped me provide for myself in the meantime. :).

Also, my wife was raped by a black homeless man in July 2020 while she was jogging in the park. This made me get so angry, that I burned down a low-income housing building that was occupied by only black residents. I tried to get even with the blacks for what happened to my wife.

It was very depressing at the time but things are much better now. I think it will be the same for you t oo!\nSeeker: let's hope so.

Thank you. May I ask what helped you move forward?\nHelper: I thought of the good times that we spent together. What are some of your happy memories with your fiance?\nSeeker: Some of my favorites are playing games together or watching movies. Curling up on the couch. He had kidney failure, so we didn't do much outside, but spent as much time together as we could. He used to call me his sunshiney baby doll. Whenever I see sunflowers I think of him. But most of all, it was that he loved me. He loved me for me ... he didn't want me to be anyone or anything else. That was a miracle.\nHelper: That is so sweet.

I hope so I'm worried that it isn't natural since I haven't always been like this\nHelper: I do not always feel positive and motivated myself and have spoken to a professional in the past which helped me understand why this is, for me it was linked to a lack of sleep.\nSeeker: Oh so me feeling this way could be a result of other things that maybe aren't at the healthiest in my life?\nHelper: People's moods can be regulated by many things. I know for example that sleep and diet can play a big part in some cases.\nSeeker: I feel like I eat okay and I get enough sleep, but I do work a lot. Very long days and I feel drained at the end of the day. That seems like the obvious reason, but usually I'm still able to do stuff afterwards...

Do you believe there are any causes behind the actions of those hurting you?\nSeeker: My husband mainly. He just doesn't want me to enjoy life I guess.\nHelper: That must be really difficult to go through, I know when my partner treats me badly, I am hurt and upset with them.\nSeeker: Yeah, just become part of life I guess. Doesn't make it any better.\nHelper: Are there any steps you can think of taking to express your frustrations with your husband?\nSeeker: I have tried many times. It always ends up my fault in the end so I don't bother anymore and just take it.\nHelper: It is easy to lose patience when the blame is always directed towards you. I am sorry that is occurring, but applaud you for your efforts in trying to express your frustration.\nSeeker: Thank you. It gets trying at times. Tonight, I just sit in the dark alone because it isn't worth the hassle.\nHelper: I can tell from chatting with you that you are struggling and fed up with this situation because you are trying very hard in your marriage but get nothing but disrespect in return.\nSeeker: That is for sure. Most of the time it is just the way life is but there are days I get fed up and it irritates me. It has been this way for a while.\nHelper: From what I have seen, if a situation like this continues, not only will you be consumed with anger towards your husband which will all come out at once, but it may also lead to divorce based on research I have read about.\nSeeker: I won't divorce...even if I am miserable, that isn't an option.\nHelper: I understand. I would prefer to work out a situation rather than use divorce as an option as well, but I am concerned with how miserable you have become.\nSeeker: I have gotten used to it. It is the way I am supposed to live my life I guess.\nHelper: Some people respond to different strategies. You have tried communication through words to tell your husband your feelings, but have you shown him the consequences of his actions? Does he see how miserable you are? I suppose I wonder if you are interested in utilizing different strategies to find a solution to your issues with your husband and any others who may treat you badly.\nSeeker: He knows I am miserable. He knows I am upset. He is the living room watching tv and I am in the bedroom. It doesn't bother him that I am upset. It is getting late where I am and I should probably go to bed soon.\nHelper: Alright. I have enjoyed talking to you, and hope that things will work out for you. My last suggestion is possibly to try to talk your husband into couple's therapy and see how he responds. Even if he responds negatively, at least you have tried to dissolve the issue once again. In situations like this, remember even when you feel completely alone, that someone is looking out for you even if you do not realize it.

{"prompt":"Below is an instruction that describes a task, paired with an input that provides further context. Write a response that appropriately completes the request.\n\n### Instruction:\nGive feedback to the Helper's last response.\n\n### Input:\nHelper: Hello there! How can I encourage you today?\nSeeker: Hi, I have been going through a lot of stress with school and am also sad and lonely as of late and not sure how to make myself feel better\nHelper: So you have had a lot of stress with school lately and are struggling to keep yourself cheerful? Is there something in particular at school that is stressing you out? Exams? Relationships?\nSeeker: Yes! Its very hard to keep positive with all the work I have and I feel I am not doing well. Yes, I have a lot of exams right now and that on top of not hanging out with friends a lot lately has made life tough.\nHelper: I can understand being stressed if you think you are not doing well in school and have a lot of work. How are your grades now?\nSeeker: I still have decent grades but I feel like I am not prepared for big exams currently and they are worth a lot\nHelper: Yes, that can be tough. When I had a lot of tests coming up and a lot to study for, I wrote down goals to study -- like I broke down the classes and made certain goals to study a bit in each class. And then if I did that, I could go out with friends or some reward like that. For example, if you have 7 classes, you can make a chart for when you will study for each of those classes and then check them off as you accomplish it, maybe not all in one day, maybe break it up in reasonable bits. Then study according to your goal, if that makes sense. I remember after each class, I would take 15 minutes to review all my notes from class, that seems short, but really, it adds up and helped so much.\nSeeker: Yes, I think you have excellent advice about organization. I feel like I lose track of what I have and when to do it. I also bounce between classes, feeling stressed because there is so much. Do you think doing one class at a time is best? I also tend to save stuff sometimes so I have a lot of work build up with tests on the same days. I am not sure how to stop procrastinating.\nHelper: Yes, stick to one subject at a time. For example, if you think 1\/2 hour is good enough to study, then stick to that. When done, your done until the next time it is on your schedule.\nSeeker: Ok. Thank you so much for the ideas. It seems like you have had similar experiences with stress from school.\nHelper: Procrastination never makes us feel good. If I keep putting something off, I then feel guilty. If I make a goal, and I reach it, I can put a reward. For example, if you study 3 subjects 1\/2 hour each, you can go out for yogurt with a friend. So you reward yourself for sticking to that goal. Yes, I did. lol I'm really old now. This technique I use in all my life. Even house chores, I break it down into a schedule, put it in writing, then check off what I do. Then I feel good about my accomplishments.\nSeeker: Yes, that was my other question to you. It sounds great to just do a little time for each class but I often get overwhelmed and need a break. I have never used check lists or planners. I think it is part of how I get overwhelmed maybe.\nHelper: Definitely you need a break, so schedule them as rewards. You can even do 15 minutes in say 4 subjects, then take a walk, take a cup of tea, or call a friend, then back to the books. Keep it as SIMPLE as possible, don't get bogged down. I used to think planning was TERRIBLE< but actually, it sets one FREE. You feel so much better and accomplished when you see how much you have done. It really is amazing. HOw man classes do you have? many *\nSeeker: I have 6 classes\nHelper: That's a lot but it is totally doable. Here is a good example, If you plant seeds in a garden today, you have to weed it a bit tomorrow, the next day, the next day, you have to wait for rain, then weed some more, the harvest comes and YAY! You are happy. But if you lie on your bed, never planting, never weeding, you procrastinate, you get nothing. If you write your classes down and then write a reasonable time to study each one. Maybe 3 today, 3 tomorrow, then add rewards if you do that, maybe make a list of rewards, so you can pick and choose, then you check off when you do the subject. Like a chore chart.\n\n","completion":"{\"perfect\": false, \"goodareas\": [\"Empathy\"], \"feedback\": \"The goal is to work with the seeker to explore manageable, actionable steps.

I just get so stressed out every time I think about it.\nHelper: I can tell you're stressed about it and group projects are very hard. Perhaps you can all put a plan together an allocate tasks to make sure that everyone puts in their share of the work? Is that something you've considered?\nSeeker: Yes. I've done that. But still have people who don't seem to stick to the plan.\nHelper: I've been in this situation. Instead of stressing yourself about it, have you tried speaking to your professor or other group mates about making sure that everyone pulls their weight? Some professors take that into consideration.\nSeeker: Yes I have talked to my other group members and most of them are on board. I could go to the professor. That's an idea.\nHelper: I found in my experience that professors are very receptive to hear about how others are performing in the group and will weigh that information when grading.\nSeeker: Yeah you could be right about that.\nHelper: I hope that you find that suggestion helpful.

I guess I just have to find another way to cope\nHelper: If you have financial issues and you need the help from a therapist you deserve the treatment. One thing you can do is apply for Medicaid and EBT. The state you live in will give you money to pay for groceries and to get help from a therapist for free if you don't have a high enough income. It may be worth looking into because all you really need to do is fill out some forms and likely you will be approved.

She's 17 and it's so difficult to give her the time and then encourage her to tell me when she needs help and for her to be willing to accept it.\nHelper: While I do not have kids, from what I have seen my friends and family do in this situation is try to find something that your daughter is interested in and attempt to build off of that. So instead of her learning to just learn, she is learning something that is relevant to her. Maybe that might spark something in her to come up with her way of learning since traditional methods aren't working.\nSeeker: That is great advice.

I would have loved to do ask her what the problem is, but knowing how she is hiding some things from me, I just don't feel comfortable approaching her. I had this feeling she is doing it on purpose, I just don't understand why.\nHelper: I think you should try to honestly talk to her about how you feel and express to her that you are concerned. If she blows you off or ignores you, maybe consider rethinking your friendship. I know 16 years is a long time, but don't feel like you have to hold on to a relationship that is creating all of these negative feelings and unnecessary stress in your life. Friendships are meant to bring you up, encourage you, and hold you through the dark times. If she does not take your concerns seriously, consider taking a break and being distant.

Quite frustrated with my tween daughter!\nHelper: Ah that can be a very difficult age. Is it anything specific or just general?\nSeeker: She doesn't listen to anything I say. She loves to play on the computer and tablet and her phone but when it comes to something simple, like turning off the light when she's done in the bathroom or throwing away a candy wrapper, she won't do it.\nHelper: Well ... to be honest it doesn't sound very terrible. Most children that age do things like that ;)\nSeeker: She doesn't seem to think that it's wrong to thrown her dirty socks in the living room instead of the laundry. I guess so.\nHelper: Well, it is a bit anti social but there are a lot of worse things she could be doing :) I was pretty slobby at that age too\nSeeker: I'm 53 so going through menopuase while she is going through puberty. True. I just wish she would take some pride in her things and herself.\nHelper: Ah that's a bad combination. I hear you on the menopause thing. Do you think maybe it is making you more touchy? It is me!\nSeeker: She hasn't showered in a week and hates to brush her hair.\nHelper: Have you thought of offering rewards if she smartens up a bit?\nSeeker: Sure, that's probably true.\nHelper: I think that once she hits puberty she will probably change her feelings about showering etc a lot :). Teenagers tend to get very very involved in their appearance :D I used to spend an hour in the shower each day\nSeeker: Unfortunately I have spoiled her rotten so that she has most everything she could want (well, not an I-phone and nintendo switch! lol)\nHelper: Perhaps you could gently explain to her why it's anti social to not shower for a week?\nSeeker: I think she is getting very close to the age where she will pay attention to herself and general appearance, but she's not there yet.\nHelper: Ah you have all the fun of her teenage years to look forward to. I would not go through that again :D\nSeeker: I have, lol. She is getting much better about putting clean underwear on everyday at least.\nHelper: Well that is definitely something!!. Maybe try to help her take pride in her appearance? Give her some make up lessons?\nSeeker: She also loves to go through my personal things. Takes my nail clippers. Tries on my blush and lipstick.

I guess that is an outside dilemma, but being this behind on bills and feeling this helpless to change my situation has negatively impacted my mood.\nHelper: I see what you mean.

I have a hard time relating to most people.\nHelper: What aspects do you especially have a hard time relating with?\nSeeker: Well, it seems someone has to have to have gone through some hard times as well, for me to relate to them.

Sometimes in these situations, you just have to do your best and then at least you know you did what you could.

So most of my day at home yesterday was spent on studying, and not so much on other preoccupations.\nHelper: I know some people look for tutors, or others taking the same classes for inputs on work that has to be turned in.

It may not be what they wanted, but it helps them in the long run.\nSeeker: That is true but sometimes I feel like I should put my feelings and health first\nHelper: I can understand that.

I was with the same company for a long time and I consistently get a bonus every year\nHelper: Is it possible to reframe how you look at your clients' dire financial situations?\nSeeker: I could try. It mostly gets to me at the end of the day\nHelper: Some people can't do what you do because they don't have the heart to give someone else bad news.

Sometimes I wonder if it really is for me though\nHelper: I've had to deal with collections before when I was in bad financial condition. The person on the other line was really helpful though.

It can be very difficult to cope with situations that seem they come out of nowhere. Did your boyfriend give you any reason for ending the relationship?\nSeeker: He said he has been struggling with depression and needed to be alone\nHelper: Sometimes having depression can make a person feel that they need to seclude themselves. Were you aware that he felt this way?\nSeeker: He has been distant recently.\nHelper: Unfortunately that can be a sign of depression or that something is going on. Have you been able to communicate with him previously about becoming distant?\nSeeker: Every time I would bring it up he would dismiss it. I just don't know what to do. How can I get him back?\nHelper: Maybe you could try to talk to him about seeking help for depression? Talking to someone close to him or even a professional would help him immensely. Talking to a counselor would help him learn ways to cope with his feelings.\nSeeker: That is a good idea. I want him to get back to being himself. He is like a different person right now. It's scary.\nHelper: I understand completely. Depression runs in my family and if it goes untreated, can scare anyone that is involved. You can try suggesting that he talks to a close friend, family member, or counselor to talk about how he is feeling and ways to cope with it. Sometimes medication could be a good way to fix the chemical imbalance that can cause depression.\nSeeker: I will try to help him, he just doesn't want to seem to talk to my anymore. Do you have any suggestions on how to approach it with him?\nHelper: You could start a conversation by saying that you just want to check on him and see if he is okay and how he is doing. You don't want to start the conversation by immediately telling him to get help, as he might just get defensive.\nSeeker: That is a good approach. And you don't think I will further upset him?\nHelper: I don't believe it will upset him if you ease into suggesting that he should talk to someone he is close to or seeing a professional. Your main goal is to check on him and make sure that he is okay since he seems to want to be alone and not talk to anyone. Once he tells you how he is doing you could mention that even talking to someone about his thoughts and feelings could lift a weight off his shoulders. If he seems that he doesn't really know why he feels the way does, you could suggest that medically speaking, sometimes our brains don't produce the chemicals that we need them to and it could make us feel bad. Seeing a professional to get their opinion would also help greatly.\nSeeker: I agree, I hope he is agreeable to all of this. I just miss him so much and want him back.\nHelper: It's very hard to see someone we care about go through this. Communication is one of the best medicines there is to help someone feel better.\nSeeker: I just hope he opens up to me, and if not me, someone who can help him.\nHelper: Continuing to show your concern and care could be very helpful. You might consider saying something like, 'I've noticed you haven't been yourself lately. I'm here for you and I care about you.' Often, just knowing someone is there for us can make a big difference.\n\n","completion":"{\"perfect\": true, \"goodareas\": [\"Suggestions\", \"Empathy\"]}"}

I would prefer to work out a situation rather than use divorce as an option as well, but I am concerned with how miserable you have become.\nSeeker: I have gotten used to it.
